<title> What we've learned in ict 10 </title>

<p>From the 1st quarter up to the 4th quarter, we learned a lot of things that we can apply in the future that were taught by our ICT teacher, Mr. Eugene M. Saguirer. As a student, we learned so many things, including that we need to be responsible when using the internet because every move we make can affect our or their lives. We should learn how to be netiquette or how we should use the internet. There are so many lessons that were taught to us, including the history of the internet. In this part, we encounter so many dangers that the internet could bring to us, and also, our ICT teacher taught us the different types of properties, such as text properties, font borders, and so on. In our last quarter, we discussed an overview of online publishing and how client-server relationships work. As a Grade 10 student and a person, we should always think twice before posting something because someone might get offended by our post.
